# Design Pattern

## Creational Pattern

| Type | When to use ? |
| ---- | ------------- |
| [Abstract Factory](abstract-factory/abstract-factory.go) |  Creating dependent object |
| [Builder](builder/builder.go) | Creating same object with different representation |
| [Factory Method](factory-method/factory.go) | Creating different subclasses that implements same superclass (interface) without creating directly |
| [Object Pool](object-pool/object-pool) | Maintain group of object |
| [Singleton](singleton/singleton.go) | Ensure object only created one time and provide global access to this object |

## Structural Pattern
| Type | When to use ? |
| ---- | ------------- |
| [Adapter](adapter/adapter.go) | Convert one object so another object can understand it |
| [Facade](facade/facade.go) | Simplified complex set of business logic into one library |

## Behavioral Pattern
| Type | When to use ? |
| ---- | ------------- |
| [Template Method](template-method/template.go) |  Skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure |
