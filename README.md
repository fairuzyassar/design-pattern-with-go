# Design Pattern

## Creational Pattern

| Type | When to use ? |
| ---- | ------------- |
| Abstract factory |  Creating dependent object |
| Builder | Creating same object with different representation |
| Factory Method | Creating different subclasses that implements same superclass (interface) without creating directly |
| Object Pool | Maintain group of object |
| Singleton | Ensure class only creating one time and provide global access to this class |
